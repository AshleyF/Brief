Here we define types representing Wasm modules and function to serialize to `.wasm` files.

The idea it to use this as a target for Brief eventually...

## TODO

* Deserialization of `.wasm` files
* Integration with [Ryan Lamansky's WebAssembly for .NET](https://github.com/RyanLamansky/dotnet-webassembly)
* Support custom "name" section; giving names to modules/functions/locals for debugging
