# Brief

Starting experimenting with Brief implementation details while documenting thoughts. Brief is a concatenative language with quotations inspired by Slava Pestov's [Factor](https://factorcode.org/), Manfred von Thun's [Joy](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/research-projects/past-projects/joy-programming-language), Charles Childers [RetroForth](http://www.retroforth.org/), Chuck Moore's [ColorForth](https://colorforth.github.io/), and many other Forths. See [Vocabulary reference](./Vocabulary.md) and the [Journal](https://github.com/AshleyF/brief/blob/gh-pages/sandbox/Language/journal/Readme.md).
