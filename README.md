# Brief

Brief is a [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language))-like concatenative language with quotations inspired by [Factor](http://factorcode.org/) and [Joy](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/research-projects/past-projects/joy-programming-language). _Very_ simple. It has taken on many forms over the years: an [embedded VM for microcontroller programming](https://github.com/AshleyF/brief/tree/gh-pages/embedded) with [.NET IL translation](https://github.com/AshleyF/brief/blob/gh-pages/embedded/Compiler/IL.fs), an [AST form used for program synthesis for learning robotics tasks](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~dang/papers/dang_iros2014.pdf), a [JavaScript-based version for web programming](http://brieflang.com/web/), and several others.

Most variations (not included here) were developed at Microsoft and remain internal.
